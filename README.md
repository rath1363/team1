PROJECT MILESTONE 1



Project Title:
	- My Weekend In Miami

Vision Statement:
	- Miami, Florida is one of the top travel destinations in the
		United States. As a domestic travel location, Miami is suitable
		for brief weekend getaways. Our application allows
		busy travelers to conveniently plan a short itinerary based
		on their budget and interests.
	- Our application will output a two-day itinerary for
		a trip to Miami. Users of the application
		will input their budget for lodging, meals, and
		entertainment along with preferences for each of
		these activities. For example, lodgings that are luxury,
		mid-tier, or budget. Meals that are Japanese, Caribbean,
		or vegan. Entertainment that is active and adventurous
		or relaxed and sedentary. Once users input their
		budget and preferences our application will output
		a suggested two-day itinerary. Users can save
		this information on the web application by creating
		a username and password that will allow them to
		log in and re-access this information in the future.
		Additionally, users can output their itinerary as
		a plain text document for printing.
	- If we have time, we could also have our application
		output itineraries to users' computers and smart phones
		via an e-mail and SMS messaging for easy reference while traveling.
		
	- If we have time, utilize a public API for data

	- As a hypothetical product, if we continued to develop this
		application, it could conceivably begin to generate revenue
		by hosting advertisements from local Miami businesses.

Motivation:
	- We anticipate that building this website will give us
		familiarity with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Additionally,
		it will allow us to build and interact with a backend
		database to store information related to lodging, dining,
		and other activities in Miami. It will also give us practice
		with designing login and user authentication systems and
		exporting information into files and perhaps e-mails and 
		SMS messages as well. As we accomplish these goals, this 
		project will also give us practice with essential practices 
		in the software development industry including Agile development,
		and version control software.

Risks
	- Unable to utilize API for data, or desired data is unavailable
	- Some team members are not familiar with coding languages used
	- Some team members do not have web development experience
	- Team members have not worked together previously
	- Some scheduling conflict, remote class makes it difficult to meet
	- Some team members are unfamilar with use of databases

Mitigation Strategy for Risks
	- Some team members have experience with web delevopment and using databases
	- Set up recurring meeting that works with all member's schedules
	- Utilize text file for database initially, utilize free resources
	- Create roles for web development to avoid overlap, teaching other members


Development Method
	- Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
		- Short-term goals stated as user stories
		- Examples:
			- Lo-Fi website functionality and features
			- Lo-Fi user interface sketches and storyboarding
			- Dedicated webpage you can navigate to in any browser
			- Webpage with basic structure mirroring proposed User Interface
			- Database of hotels
			- Search feature of hotels
			- Export of hotel itinerary
			- Database of restaurants
			- Search feature of restaurants
			- Combining of hotel and restaurants into single itinerary
			- Exporting this combined itinerary
			- Etc.
	- Test Driven Development (TDD)
	- Weekly scrum meetings with rotating Scrum Master
	- Possible bi-weekly meetings closer to due date

Project Tracking Software
	- Github Project
